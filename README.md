# Passenger-Journey-Forecast
PassengerJourneyForecast is an advanced predictive modeling tool designed to estimate future passenger journeys within public transportation systems. By leveraging historical data and employing machine learning algorithms, specifically the XGBoost model, this tool analyzes trends in passenger usage across various service types.With features like lagged passenger counts and other relevant indicators, PassengerJourneyForecast provides reliable forecasts that help transit agencies make informed decisions regarding service scheduling, capacity planning, and resource allocation. This predictive capability enhances operational efficiency, improves service reliability, and ultimately leads to a better travel experience for passengers. Whether for strategic planning or real-time adjustments, PassengerJourneyForecast empowers transportation authorities to stay ahead of demand fluctuations.

Features:

Data Preprocessing: Loads, cleans, and preprocesses daily passenger journey data.
Lag Feature Engineering: Creates lagged features to capture temporal dependencies in the data.
Model Training: Trains an XGBoost regression model to forecast future passenger journeys.
Evaluation Metrics: Assesses model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Visualization: Plots actual versus predicted passenger journeys for better insight.

Usage:

Clone the repository.
Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (pandas, numpy, xgboost, scikit-learn, matplotlib,sns).
Load your dataset in the specified format to make predictions.
This project serves as a foundational tool for transportation authorities to optimize service planning and improve operational efficiency based on predictive insights.
